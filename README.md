## Introduction
Server-side and Web APIs can be utilized to minimize developer code and provide longevity of website data given that the APIs are active and being updated by respective API owners. The foundation of the Videogame Vixens website utilizes RAWG.io API to fetch data on newly released video games and their corresponding consoles/platforms to provide for users. Additionally, the Videogame Vixens website utilizes DadJokes API to fetch data providing dad jokes. To further integrate these APIs into the Videogame Vixens website, our group created HTML, JavaScript, Vanilla CSS, and incorporated Skeleton CSS to style and provide functionality to the website. HTML outlines the structure of the website, Vanilla CSS provides the layout and background for the website, and Skeleton CSS polishes the fonts, text sizing, and background cosmetics. The Videogame Vixens website utilizes a media.js file to organize the layout and array of homepage media, whereas separate JavaScript files code the functionality, modals, and API data of the "Find New Games Here" and "Want to Hear a Joke?" buttons. Users can click on either modal buttons to prompt respective API data, "Find New Games Here" and "Want to Hear a Joke?". For the "Find New Games Here," users can scroll to access the displayed list of newly released games, whereas users can navigate the "Want to Hear a Joke?" by choosing the button/modal and typing "yes" (that they do want to hear a joke) or by typing "no" to close the modal. 

// Add later //

Finally, users can choose the "Favorites" button in order to save their favorite games or dad jokes, and the website will retain this specific client-data. 

// Also add to JS section how we coded in "Favorites" //

2. Click on either the "Find New Games Here" or "Want to Hear a Joke?" buttons to prompt modals.
